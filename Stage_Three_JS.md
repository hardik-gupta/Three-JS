<h2> Spot Light Follower in Three JS</h2>
<h4> The Second Three JS project. This time tackling the Spot Light.
     Just like the Point Light in our previous project, where we made it follow the mouse cursor,
     I wanted to do the same with a Spot Light. So I set up a stage scene with a Spot Light (kinda like an auditorium)
     to mimic how it behaves in real life. Unlike our previous project, changing the 'position' parameters
     of the light, as the cursor moves, does not work. So we have to create a 3D Object called target and set
     it so as the spotlight points from its position to the target's position.
