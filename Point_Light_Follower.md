<h2> Point Light Follower in Three JS </h2>
<h4> I have been learning Three JS for a month and I have been making small Three JS Projects to put I have learned to the test.
     So here is my first small Three JS project.
     <br>A Three JS Scene where the point light follows the mouse cursor as it moves around on the screen.
     As you move the cursor around, you can see the objects ( Sphere, Cube, Torus, Pyramid, Plane) become
     visible. </h4>
<h4> Check out the Codepens and JSFiddle links for the code and the scene.
